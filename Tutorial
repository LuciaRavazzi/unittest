A test could be:
- *Manual*: it occurs when you test your app by yourself (exploratory testing). Exploratory testing is a form of testing that is done without a plan. In an exploratory test, youâ€™re just exploring the application. In order to do this, you have to take into account all the functionalities of 
your app, set the input and output and understand if after some modification, the result remains the same. 
- *Automated*: in order to automatize the previous process, a script could be written for this purpose. 

There are two types of tests:
- *Unit* tests a single component. 
- *Integration* tests different components and the integration between them. 

In general, the *unittest* module helps you to test your componenets comparing a fixed result with the output. 

However, when tests are executed, it isn't necessary to import all things: so, it is possible to _simulate_ them as they
are real objects. This can be done by means of the unittest.mock.Mock or unittest.mock.patch method: the first one simulate 
your function, the second one is decorator (a function that takes in input a function and return another function). 
The Mock() function must have all the functionalities that the original object has, otherwise it will not be able to simulate it; 
it can simulate any object, like libraries, attributes, functions etc.
